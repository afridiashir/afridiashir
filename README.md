Hey, I’m Ashir, a Full-Stack Software Engineer based in Pakistan.

I have 2+ years of professional experience building scalable web applications and SaaS platforms, mostly for startups and early-stage products. I’ve worked across the stack using MERN, Next.js, NestJS, Laravel, and DevOps, with a strong focus on clean architecture and performance.

Currently, I’m building [Seltrax](https://seltrax.com) — an eCommerce platform aimed at making online selling more accessible by removing the high costs and technical barriers of existing solutions. I’m working end-to-end on the product, from architecture and development to product decisions and execution.
